## 2018 Mortimer Spiegelman Award: Call for Nominations
 
The Applied Public Health Statistics Section of the American Public Health Association (APHA) invites nominations for the 2018 Mortimer Spiegelman Award, which honors a statistician below the age of 40 in the calendar year of the award who has made outstanding contributions to health statistics, especially public health statistics. The award was established in 1970 and is presented annually at the APHA meeting. The award serves the following three purposes:

- To honor the outstanding achievements of both the recipient and Spiegelman
- To encourage further involvement in public health by the finest young statisticians
- To increase awareness of APHA and the Applied Public Health Statistics Section in the academic statistical community
 
The Spiegelman Award recipient must be a health statistician who has made outstanding contributions to statistical methodology and its applications in public health (broadly defined).
 
The award is open to early career investigators regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, nationality or citizenship. Specifically, candidates must meet at least one of the following criteria:

- Candidate must be under age 40 throughout the award calendar year; or
- Candidate must have obtained a terminal degree in statistics or a statistics-related field in the last 10 years.
 
For those receiving a terminal degree after considerable professional experience, contributions during and subsequent to the degree will be considered by the committee, and nominators are strongly encouraged to contact the Committee Chair with any questions about whether the nominee qualifies as an early career investigator.
