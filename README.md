## 2018 Mortimer Spiegelman Award: Call for Nominations
 
The Applied Public Health Statistics Section of the American Public Health Association (APHA) invites nominations for the 2018 Mortimer Spiegelman Award, which honors a statistician below the age of 40 in the calendar year of the award who has made outstanding contributions to health statistics, especially public health statistics. The award was established in 1970 and is presented annually at the APHA meeting. The award serves the following three purposes:

- To honor the outstanding achievements of both the recipient and Spiegelman
- To encourage further involvement in public health by the finest young statisticians
- To increase awareness of APHA and the Applied Public Health Statistics Section in the academic statistical community
 
The Spiegelman Award recipient must be a health statistician who has made outstanding contributions to statistical methodology and its applications in public health (broadly defined).
 
The award is open to early career investigators regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, nationality or citizenship. Specifically, candidates must meet at least one of the following criteria:

- Candidate must be under age 40 throughout the award calendar year; or
- Candidate must have obtained a terminal degree in statistics or a statistics-related field in the last 10 years.
 
For those receiving a terminal degree after considerable professional experience, contributions during and subsequent to the degree will be considered by the committee, and nominators are strongly encouraged to contact the Committee Chair with any questions about whether the nominee qualifies as an early career investigator.
 
Please email the following to the award committee chair, John Storey, at spiegelmanaward@gmail.com by **April 6, 2018**:

1. A nominating letter that states the candidate’s date of birth and how their contributions relate to public health concerns
2. Up to three letters of support
3. The candidate’s detailed CV

## About Mortimer Spiegelman

Mortimer Spiegelman (1901-1969) was an actuary, biostatistician, and demographer who made exceptional contributions to public health. His contributions have continued posthumously through the APHA's Statistics Section's Mortimer Spiegelman Award.
Mr. Spiegelman was a native of Brooklyn, New York. He received a Master's of Engineering from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in 1923 and a Master's of Business Administration from Harvard University in1925. He spent 40 years on the staff of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company where he published many articles and volumes that attained national and international recognition. He coauthored with Dublin and Lotka The Money Value of Man and Length of Life, both of which have been standard reference volumes.   Although his employment was in an organization that was concerned primarily with actuarial science, his interests were much broader.  He published two editions of Introduction to Demography, which has been a standard text in demography.  The second edition, in particular, is oriented toward the general demographer and students of public health statistics rather than toward the actuary. He did extensive work on life tables including what he referred to as "segmented generation" mortality.  This approach allows one to follow the mortality experience of a given age group over successive 10-year periods as an alternative to analyzing trends in the current mortality.

His major contribution in the fields of public health and epidemiology came toward the end of his career when he conceived of, coordinated, edited, and carried to a successful conclusion the publication of a series of monographs sponsored by the APHA and published by the Harvard University Press. Each monograph pertained to a specific set of diseases, and the 1960 Census was used in a standard way as the denominator for rates of disease. In his role as editor of this series, he used his considerable powers of persuasion with the authors of the monographs to ensure comparability among them and to make certain that the work on each was completed.   Sixteen monographs resulted from his efforts; covering a wide range of topics as evidenced by the following titles: Accidents and Homicides, Infectious Diseases, Trends and Variations in Fertility in the U.S., Infant, Perinatal, Maternal, and Childhood Mortality, The Epidemiology of Oral Health, Tuberculosis, Syphilis and Other Venereal Diseases, Cardiovascular Disease in the U.S., The Frequency of Rheumatic Diseases, Digestive Disease, Mental Disorders and Suicide, Cancer in the U.S., The Epidemiology of Neurological and Sense Organ Diseases, Mortality and Morbidity in the U.S., and Differential Mortality in the U.S.  Mr. Spiegelman's development of the APHA monograph series further illustrates the breadth of his interests.  

Mr. Spiegelman was a Fellow of the Society of Actuaries, a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, and a Fellow of the American Public Health Association
The Spiegelman Award was established in 1970 by his sisters, Anna and Julia Spiegelman, following his death.
